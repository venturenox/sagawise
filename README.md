# Saga wise

![sagawise platform logo](sdk/sagawise-platform-logo-1024x641-removebg-preview.png)

**Saga wise** is a distributed transaction management tool based on the Saga pattern for managing long-running transactions. It helps coordinate the distributed workflow across services by tracking each task's status and ensuring fault tolerance using compensating transactions. The project is built using **Go-Lang**, **Redis**, and **PostgreSQL** to handle scalability and durability.

## Getting Started

1. **Set Environment Variables**
   - For the `dev` environment, configure variables inside the `.env` file.
   - For production and other environments, ensure variables are defined as per environment-specific settings.

2. **Define Workflows in DSL Files**
   - Workflow DSL files are stored in `/backend/sagawise/` as JSON files.
   - The format and rules for these files are explained below - [DSL Files](#dsl-files).

3. **Run the Project**
   - Start the containers and necessary services by using the `make` command.

4. **Start Workflow Instance**
   - Use the `start_instance` endpoint of **Saga wise** to initialize a workflow from the publishing service.

5. **Publish Event**
   - Inform **Saga wise** about a `publish` event by sending a request to the "Publish Event" endpoint from the publishing service.

6. **Consume Event**
   - Inform **Saga wise** about a `consume` event by sending a request to the "Consume Event" endpoint from the publishing service.

7. **Failure Reporting**
   - Ensure every service has a failure report webhook registered to handle task failures. This should follow the format: `/v1/sagawise/failure_report/`.

8. **Dashboard Monitoring**
   - Use **Saga wise** API dashboard to get an overview of workflows and track events.

9. **Logging and Debugging**
   - Access logs to debug and monitor runtime messages.

## DSL Files
The purpose of the DSL is to define a workflow(s) of Sagas among different services so that they can registered with SagaWise in order to monitored.

Consider the following requirements while creating your DSL Files:

1. Each Workflow should have it's own DSL file.
2. File naming convention should be: `workflow_name.json`
 	Note: Workflow names should NOT container spaces. Spaces must be converted into underscores `_`
4. First root key must be `workflow`
5. Inside `workflow` key, there must be following keys:
	1. `version` defines version of workflow.
	2. `schema_version` defines version of the schema to be used by the DSL files. Current value `1.0`
	3. `name` defines the name of workflow (without spaces).
6. Last key inside the root "workflow" object, must be the `tasks` key, which is an array of objects.
7. Inside each task object, there must be these keys:
	1. `topic` defines the Kafka topic on which this task is publishing and consuming messages.
	2. `from` defines the name of service which producer the message in this task (see below heading).
	3. `to` defines the name of service which (is supposed to) consume the message in this task (see below heading).
	4. `timeout` defines the timeout for the consuming service to consume task, or the time the task should be completed in. Value is integer type and time is in `milliseconds`.

---

## Services.json file

This file defines the participating services. Each object must follow this format:

1. Service names MUST be defined in `services.json` file as array of objects.
2. Each object defined in "services.json" file MUST follow this syntax:
	1. `service_name` defines the name of service.
	2. `failure_url` defines the url of failure endpoint.
3. Following rules apply to the service name:
	1. It should NOT contain **whitespaces**.
	2. It MUST be **small-case**.
